### Approaching a Take-Home Challenge

1. Read the prompt carefully. Note any questions for your recruiter and anything you don't know how to do yet.

1. Ask questions to clarify the problem, if you need to.

1. Plan your general strategy for solving the problem.  Prioritize which parts seem most important.

1. Create code 'stubs' or 'skeletons' that capture your plan.

1. Quickly build key parts you already know how to build.  

1. Research and build all other parts in order of what seems easiest or most important.



### Key Strategies

1. Document your thinking. This could include a simple readme that has your planning notes and links to resources you found, 'stubs' or 'skeleton code' that shows the structure you are building out, comments, or tests.  This includes "next steps" - save time at the end of the timeframe to document where you left off and how you would complete the problem.

1. Consider best practices for code structure. Object-oriented code is considered a sign of a more mature developer, compared to functional code. Code that doesn't use functions is probably not DRY and generally less maintainable.

1. Consider best practices for software development workflow.  Track your work with version control like git.  Check with your recruiter before you publish information about a company's take-home challenge on GitHub or similar sites, though.  

1. Follow submission instructions. Make sure you understand the format the company wants your submission in and when they want it by (time and day).
